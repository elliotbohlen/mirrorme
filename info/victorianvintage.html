And h<em>o</em>w he kisses the deceitful f<em>o</em>unt; and h<em>o</em>w he thrusts his arms t<em>o</em> catch the neck that's pictured in the middle <em>o</em>f the stream!

But why, O f<em>o</em><em>o</em>lish b<em>o</em>y, s<em>o</em> vainly catching at this flitting f<em>o</em>rm? The cheat that y<em>o</em>u are seeking has n<em>o</em> place.
